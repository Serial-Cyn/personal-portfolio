## Greetings!
Hello, World! This is my **first personal portfolio** to be deployed on the internet. I plan to compile all of my **best works** here and be publicly showcased for various purposes, it could be for recruiters, clients, friends, and more!


## Some notes.
I mainly take on the role of a **Game** and **Web Developer**! However, due to my curiosity and desire to grow, I also learned various technologies and tools! I know how to use **SQL, Java, C++, Python, Unity, Godot, and Arduino**. This portfolio of mine will serve as the proof of my abilities and versatility!


## Technologies used:
In this portfolio, I used the following frameworks:
