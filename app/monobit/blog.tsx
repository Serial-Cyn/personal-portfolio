            Monobit was first initiated as an individual case study for a Major
            Subject during my 2nd year at the university. The project aimed to
            create an educational game that would help users learn programming
            languages in, not only an effective and interactive way, but also a
            fun way. This idea stemmed from the observation that many people
            struggle to grasp programming concepts through traditional learning
            methods.

            The development process began with extensive research on existing
            educational games and programming learning tools. I identified key
            features that would enhance user engagement and learning outcomes.
            The game was designed to include various levels, each focusing on
            different programming concepts, with challenges and quizzes to test
            the player&apos;s knowledge. Interviewing potential users is also part of
            the research process to gather pain spots and preferences, this
            allowed me to tailor the game mechanics and content to better suit
            the target audience.

          <p className="mb-4">
            The development of Monobit involved several stages, starting with
            prototyping and user testing. I utilized tools like Figma for UI/UX
            design and Aseprite for creating pixel art graphics. At this stage,
            I focused on creating a simple yet engaging interface that would
            appeal to users of all ages.

          <p className="mb-4">
            As the project progressed, I implemented feedback from user testing
            to refine the gameplay mechanics and educational content. This
            iterative process ensured that the game remained engaging while
            effectively teaching programming concepts. I also collaborated with
            peers and mentors to gain insights and improve the overall quality
            of the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            These stages were repeated multiple times to ensure the final product was both
            enjoyable and educational. The culmination of this effort resulted
            in Monobit, a game that not only entertains but also empowers users
            to learn programming in a more interactive way.

            Currently, Monobit is still a work in progress, with plans to expand its
            content and features. Future updates will include additional levels,
            more programming languages, and enhanced graphics and sound effects
            to further immerse players in the learning experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I plan to develop Monobit into a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform,
            allowing users to be able to access the game from any device! This will 
            achieve my goal of making programming education more accessible and 
            engaging for a wider audience.
